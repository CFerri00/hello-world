## Career transition to Business and Data Analysis 
 
> Focusing on core analysis competencies:
1. Microsoft Excel for Analysis
2. SQL
3. Tableau
4. Power BI
5. Python
6. R

I hold a Bachelor of Science Degree in Technical Management. My professional experience is in Pharmacy as a pharmacy technician, Air Gateway Management, and Health and Safety. When faced with navigating a career change, I earned my Health and Life license in the state of Arizona and became a Senior Benefit Consultant selling medicare products. During this time I reflected on my passion for tech, the hours I spent tinkering and organizing computer files from a young age, and excelling in my collegiate Probability and Statistics courses. This lead me to choosing to being the journey into data analytics and the Google Cert seemed like the obvious first step. Since my covid related layoff, I have been taking full advantage of access to coursera provided by my states department of labor. I am currently working on the aforementioned courses which I am enrolled and building a portfolio of projects, which has led me to using and understanding Github. 
---I have completed the following course work:
1. Google Data Analytics Certificate: A collection of MOOC's geared towards individuals with no prior Data Analytics experience. These courses introduce the data analytics process, data driven decision making, how to think like a data analyst, and using data analytics tools such as excel, SQL, Tableau, and R.
2. Introduction to Probability and Data with R offered from Duke University
3. Business Analysis Foundations - LinkedIn
4. Certified Analytics Professional (CAP) Cert Prep: Domains 1-4 - LinkedIn
5. Certified Analytics Professional (CAP) Cert Prep: Domains 5-7 - LinkedIn
6. SQL for Non-Programmers - LinkedIn
7. Introduction to R Programming for Data Science - IBM Skills Network
8. Introduction to Data Analytics - IBM Skills Network
9. Getting Started with Power BI - LinkedIn
10. Build Data Analysis Tools using R and DPLYR

---I am currently enrolled in:
1. Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business - Duke University
2. SQL for Data Science - University of California, Davis
I enjoyed learning about and using R from the Google course and completed some additional studies with R immediately after. I have since realized that programming could wait as I hone my skills in excel, SQL, and data visualization first.

I am comfortable using excel for various tasks including pivot tables and VLOOKUP, understand databases, beginner to intermediate SQL queries, creating visualizations in tableau, and data manipulation and visualization in R. 

My short and long term goals are:
1. Become employed in a role where I can continue to use excel and SQL. 
2. Become a confident professional data analyst while working towards learning more Python. 
3. Become a Data Scientist.

While I have access to coursera, MOOC's have their own challenges as they are not as structered and ridgid as a paid service. I have been considering either a bootcamp or Masters Degree program though have not enrolled in one as I feel building a portfolio is it's own proof of skill level to potential employers and think this is where my priorities should lie.
